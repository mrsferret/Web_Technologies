## PHP, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, MySQL, XAMPP, PHPMyAdmin, SQL
This course taught web development and its associated technologies by the incremental building of skills from  
The goal was to be able to produce by the end of the course a fully working CRUD web shopping app. 

This was taught in 3 stages with associated challenges.
## Stage 1
Learning the basics of coding using PHP:

- Variables and Data Types
- Strings, numbers and maths 
- Arrays
- Functions
- Decision Making
- Loops
- PHP Superglobals

[Challenge 1 code](/Challenge_1)

[Challenge 2 code](Challenge_2)


## Stage 2

Using the skills learned in Stage 1, start to incrementally build the componenets of a web shopping app:

- use PHP forms to collect data
- create php scripts to perform CRUD operations on a database
- implement error handling
- use cookies and sessions to save user information
- create an html/php Create Account form to accept and verify user information and store it in a database
- create an html/php Login form using PHP sesions with database integration
- create a Logout system to end session data in PHP

## Stage 3
The final challenge was to use everything learned to develop a simple, yet functional PHP shopping cart app that allows the users to add/remove/update items in their cart as well as calculating the the total cost of the basket items. 
The developed app will incorporate the following:
- functionality to add/remove/update products to a cart and to checkout
- use of PHP sessions to manage user data and shopping cart information
- create database tables 'orders' and 'order_content' that will store product and customer data for each order.
- the design and coding of the shopping user interface, incorporating responsive design techniques to ensure compatability with different devices.
